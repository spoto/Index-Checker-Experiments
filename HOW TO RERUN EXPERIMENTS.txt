Experiments can be rerun on the Julia cloud service:

- connect to https://portal.juliasoft.com
- create an account
- download and install the Eclipse plugin as described at login time
- click on the Eclipse project to analyze
- click on the J icon for Julia in Eclipse
- deselect all basic and advanced checkers
- in the advanced checkers section, select Termination only
- open the options for Termination: modify checkArrays to true, callContexts to false and podelskiRybalchenko to false
- click to Finish and wait until the analysis completes
- inspect the warnings in the Julia view in Eclipse

The Julia cloud service is tuned with a slightly different configuration
than what is described in the article, in order to bound the complexity of
the analysis under a safe threshold and keep the server alive. In particular,
the maximal size of zones is smaller than 200 and widening is applied earlier.
Hence results will be slightly degrated wrt those described in the article.
